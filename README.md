# hello-world
A repository for random notes, test code, and whatever else I can't justify having its own repo.

Hello, World. My name is Ryan and I am learning to code with the goal of becoming a competent and efficient programmer. 
I don't yet know what are I'll pursue, but as I lean more languages and practice my different skills, I hope to find an 
area that provides interesting work with impactful aspirations. Currently living abroad and hoping to continue working 
remotely but in this new and exciting field.

End.
